# Seminar 1 Reflections

## Time approximation
I think i spent about 8 hours total preparing for this seminar.

## What I learned
I have learned how to use UML, what a Domain Model and System Sequence Diagram is.

## What was difficult and easy
It was hard to understand what a correct DM is supposed to look like, from the book and lectures it seems like it is correct if it "feels good" but that is very subjective. This leads to the requirements being very vague and everyone having different opinions about it. I don't really understand what a DM is even used for, I know it wouldn't have helped me understand a problem better than the requirement specification already did.

Easy part was the same as the hard part, because of the vague requirements it was impossible to tell if something was wrong and therefore everything was correct.

## How I worked
I started with watching the relevant lectures and reading the book. I then just followed the steps of the lecturer and solved the problems with some creativity.

## Suggestions for the course
Explain how anything in this course (atleast from seminar 1) will help us in our future workplace.
