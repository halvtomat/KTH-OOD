# Seminar 3 reflections

### How much time was spent?
~6 hours

### What have I learned?
That more classes and complexity == better code

### What was difficult/easy?
Once again it was difficult knowing what is wanted of me,
my previous knowledge from countless programming courses
tells me to design programs in one way and this course 
seems to go against everything I know.

It was easy to code.

### How did I work?
I designed the program in seminar 2, so I just started
implementing the design I already had.

### What questions remain?
I got feedback on my assignment, I got 0/2 points.

What annoys me about this is that I don't agree with the
points brought up in the feedback.

Most changes required to pass are changes on features that
weren't required of me in the first place. It was on 
features that I implemented to make the program acctually
run, which makes the assignment a little more fun. I know
that most people made the program completely uninteractable
but they probably passed anyway.

Basically I failed the seminar because I tried to make the
program acctually work instead of creating something useless.

### Suggestions regarding the course?
Be more clear about what is required in the seminars, right
now it feels like you just assess an assignment by feeling
and not by any real criteria.
